Philipp Eisenhauer
==================

I am an economist studying the economics and econometrics of human capital investments.  My current research focuses on the effect of ambiguity on human capital investments in dynamic life-cycle models. I hope to gain a better understanding of the observed investment patterns and the effectiveness of human capital policies.

Please see my `curriculum vitae <https://github.com/peisenha/curriculum_vitae/blob/master/dist/eisenhauer_cv.pdf>`_ for more details.

Research Software
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`respy <http://respy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ is an open-source package for the simulation and estimation of a prototypical finite-horizon discrete choice dynamic programming model.

`grmpy <http://grmpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ is an open-source Python package for the simulation and estimation of the generalized Roy model.
