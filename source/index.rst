Philipp Eisenhauer
==================

I am an economist studying risk and ambiguity in economic models.  My current research focuses on the effect of ambiguity on human capital investments in dynamic life-cycle models. I hope to gain a better understanding of the observed investment patterns and the effectiveness of human capital policies.

Please see my `curriculum vitae <https://github.com/peisenha/curriculum_vitae/blob/master/curriculum_vitae.pdf>`_ for more details.

Eisenhauer, P. (2016). Human Capital Investment under Risk and Ambiguity

*	I instill a fear of model misspecification into the agents of a dynamic human capital model. Agents are ambiguity averse and seek robust decisions for a variety of alternative models. I study the implications for agentsâ€™ decisions and the design and impact of alternative policies.

Research Software
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`respy <http://respy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ is an open-source Python package for the simulation and estimation of a prototypical finite-horizon discrete choice dynamic programming model.
