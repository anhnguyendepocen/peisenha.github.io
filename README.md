# peisenha.github.io

Repository for my personal website.

## Workflow for changes to the website
* Implement changes in **source/index.rst**
* Use command **make html** in shell
* Inspect changes locally by opening **build/html/index.html** in your web browser
* Make changes as needed
* If everything is aligned, commit and push
* Inspect changes in the uploaded version once again
